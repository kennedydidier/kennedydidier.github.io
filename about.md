Hi! I'm Kennedy, a 23-year-old PhD student in the quantitative social sciences looking to transition to a data science industry position. Welcome to my ever-expanding and ever-evolving portfolio! Currently, it's filled with some projects I've adapted from social science datasets for business insights. It's also home to the work I'm currently doing for my client Cindy Schwall, one of the top realtors in Westchester County, who hired me to mine her sales data for insights and track unconventional KPIs. While I have been doing data analysis and data science work in an academic setting for years, I'm hoping that this portfolio showcases my range of skills and my eagerness and ability to use them to effectively generate actionable business insights.  
  
  
I'm deeply passionate about digging into data. I am endlessly fascinated by sorting through vast quantities of data and using it to predict the future. I'm a born problem-solver and insight generator, but my true standout talent is my ability to communicate data insights to clients in a clear, actionable way. I'm extremely eager to use my skills in a business context and I hope my portfolio shows my proficiency and promise!  
  
   
Feel free to look around and explore! My projects are tagged by topic and programming language. For a quick run down, my [resume] (https://kennedydidier.github.io/resume/) tab highlights all of the need-to-know qualifications that I will bring to your company. My LinkedIn, GitHub, and email are linked in my footer. I look forward to hopefully using my skills to drive your company to new heights!
