Hi! I'm Kennedy, a 26-year-old statistics developer at the National Hockey League. Welcome to my ever-expanding and ever-evolving portfolio! While most of my recent work involves querying, cleaning, and modeling proprietary data, these are some projects I did in graduate school using social science data sets from my doctoral program and data from my past contract work. I have a page [here](https://kennedydidier.github.io/r/python/sql/2024/08/20/Current-Projects/) devoted to descriptions of my current projects.
  
  
As the eldest daughter of a football-playing dad with no sons, I was raised on ESPN and AM Sports Radio. I spent my childhood asking questions like "Do the Padres win more when Adrian Gonzalez is in the cleanup spot?" and "How often does the team to score the first goal in hockey win the game?" Even when my dad didn't know the answer, he encouraged me to track it myself, and I became a life-long sports fan who always had _lots_ and _lots_ of questions. When I started taking advanced statistics courses in graduate school, I realized I was learning skills that I could use working as a sports stats analyst, and I chose to leave my program and take a job at the NHL. 
  
   
Feel free to look around and explore! My projects are tagged by topic and programming language. For a quick run down, my [resume](https://kennedydidier.github.io/resume/) tab describes my most recent work, including the projects I can't put up here. My LinkedIn, GitHub, and email are linked in my footer. Thanks for checking it out!
